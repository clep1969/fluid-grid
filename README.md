# fluid-grid

This page serves to demonstrate a fluid, responsive grid system in 12- and 16-column flavors. Using media queries, the page reflows and serves screens from 240px wide to full-size desktop resolutions. IE 7 and 8 are served a separate stylesheet that preserves the fluid layout but does not support media queries. (I will continue working on integrating these into the IE stylesheets using respond.js.)
